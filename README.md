    <i>A discord bot made in the discord.py library for the Antistasi Ultimate Community.</i>
  </p>
  <p>

# FIRST TIME SETUP:
Run `[install].bat`
or
`pip install discord.py requests`

## Manual Requirements:
Create a file to start the bot. This can be any file that will run the main.py file. In this case we're going to use .bat

Name this file `[start].bat` and inside of it place the code that will run main.py. Example: `py main.py`, `python main.py`

### Token

Create a python file called `bot_token.py` in the root folder and inside it add these 2 variables:
```py
token = BOT_TOKEN # Replace with the bot token, as string
debug = False # Keep as false unless you know exactly what this does
```

# Features:
A ton of slash commands to make life easier.
